Funding organisations are more likely to award scholarships to students who have shown their ability by already passing the application process. Within Mahidol University the Faculty of Graduate Studies have <a href="http://www.grad.mahidol.ac.th/en/scholarships/">scholarships</a> for both new entry students and students who have already passed coursework and qualifying examination and are ready to conduct research. (See details: <a href="http://www.grad.mahidol.ac.th/en/scholarships/">http://www.grad.mahidol.ac.th/en/scholarships/</a>) Some scholarships are full scholarships and some are partial scholarships according to the funding organisation. Potential scholarship students should note that scholarships after announcement have a short application period, so students desiring scholarships should respond quickly.   </p>
